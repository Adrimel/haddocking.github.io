In this page you can find links to the tutorials given during the BioExcel Community Forum 2017.
Those tutorials are first attempts to setup a workflow between HADDOCK, CPMD and GROMACS for 
the covalent docking of a ligand into the active site of a protein.
It does not aim (yet) at providing a well-established protocol but rather
open discussions and shows the actual limits of the different methods to solve this
issue.

This tutorial is an initiative of the Integrative Modelling and Hybrid Mathodes Interest Groups
nested at BioExcel. Feedbacks/questions are more than welcome! 

You can actively contribute to the dedicated topic on [our forum](http://ask.bioexcel.eu/t/community-forum-2017-modelling-of-a-covalent-inhibitor/629)
