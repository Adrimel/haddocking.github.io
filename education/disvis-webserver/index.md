## Introduction

DisVis is a software developed in our lab to visualize and quantify the information content of distance restraints 
between macromolecular complexes. It is open-source and available for download from our [Github repository][link-disvis].
To facilitate its use, we have developed a [web portal][link-disvis-web] for it.


This tutorial demonstrates the use of the DisVis web server. The server makes use of either 
local resources on our cluster, using the multi-core version of the software, or GPGPU-accelerated grid resources of the 
[EGI](http://www.egi.eu) to speed up the calculations. It only requires a web browser to work and benefits from the latest
developments in the software based on a stable and tested workflow. Next to providing an automated workflow around DisVis, 
the web server also performs some postprocessing of the DisVis output using [UCSF Chimera][link-chimera] to provide a
first overview of the interaction space between the two molecules.

The case we will be investigating is the interaction between two proteins of the 26S proteasome of S. pombe, PRE5 
(UniProtKB: [O14250](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O14250)) and PUP2 (UniProtKB: [Q9UT97](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UT97)). 
Seven cross-links (4 ADH & 3 ZL) are available ([Leitner et al., 2014](https://dx.doi:10.1073/pnas.1320298111)) and on top of which 
we will add two false-positive restraints. We will try to see if DisVis is able to filter out these false-positive 
restraints while asserting the true interaction space between the two chains.
We will then use the interaction analysis feature of DisVis that allows for a more complete analysis of the residues 
putatively involved in the interaction between the two molecules. To do so, we will extract all accessible residues of
the two partners, and give the list of residue to DisVis using its interaction analysis feature.
Finally, we will show how the restraints can be provided to HADDOCK in order to model the 3D interaction between the
 2 partners.

Throughout the tutorial, colored text will be used to refer to questions or 
instructions and/or PyMol commands.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">This is a question prompt: try answering 
it!</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">This an instruction prompt: follow it!</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">This is a PyMol prompt: write this in the 
Chimera command line prompt!</a>


## Setup

In order to run this tutorial, which can be run from any operating system and does not require Linux expertise, you will 
need to install [PyMol][link-pymol] on your computer in order to visualise the input and output data.  
Further, the required data to run this tutorial should be downloaded from this [link][link-data].
Once downloaded, make sure to unpack the archive.


## Inspecting the data

Let us first inspect the data we have available, namely the two individual structures as well as the distance restraints
we will provide as input. 

Using PyMol, we can easily visualize the models and the identified cross-links as distance restraints, mostly with a few 
lines of command within PyMol software.

For this open the PDB files `PRE5.pdb` and `PUP2.pdb`.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  PyMol Menu -> File -> Open... -> Select the file
</a>

Repeat this for each file. PyMol will automatically guess their type.

If you want to use instead the the PyMol command-line and type:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/PRE5.pdb
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/PUP2.pdb
</a> 

We voluntarily placed the two molecules in a particular conformation found in a known structure of the 26S proteasome solved
 by X-ray at a 2.4Ã… resolution and released in november 2016 (see [associated article](https://dx.doi.org/10.15252/embj.201695222)).
 The 1st step will be to slightly adapt the look of the molecules to easily spot the interesting regions.
We will first draw them using a cartoon representation for the protein backbone and hide the side chains for better clarity.
To do so type:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  show cartoon
</a>

You can explore quickly the two chains and try to imagine where their interactive regions will be located.

Now, we will visualize the cross-links identified in the two articles mentioned above. The cross-link will be visualized by
 drawing a line for each bond identified between each pair of atoms.
We have to look at the file gathering the distance restraints to extract the information.
Open `restraints.txt` from the tutorial input data with your favorite text editor.

To draw a line between two atoms in PyMol, we will use the distance widget. And first, we will slightly change the way those
distances will be displayed in PyMol:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  set dash_gap, 0
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  set dash_radius, 0.4
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  set dash_gap, 0
</a>

Then we draw the cross-links pair by pair by using the ['distance'](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Distance) command as
explained [here](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Lines).

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance d, /PRE5//A/27/CA, /PUP2//A/18/CA
</a>

Repeat the command for each restraint present in the `restraints.txt` file.

We can already see that some restraints do not fit well with the X-ray information obtained previously.
We will try to assess the quality of the restraints with DisVis and try to figure out which restraints might be false positive
thanks to an exhaustive analysis of the interaction space between the two molecules.


## Accessible interaction space search

DisVis performs a full and systematic 6 dimensional search of the three translational and rotational degrees of freedom to 
determine the number of complexes consistent with the restraints. In addition, it outputs the percentage of restraints 
being violated and a density that represents the center-of-mass position of the scanning chain corresponding to the 
highest number of consistent restraints at every position in space.

DisVis requires three input: two high-resolution atomic structures of the
biomolecules to be analysed (`PRE5.pdb` and `PUP2.pdb`) and a list of distance restraints, under TBL format, with which 
 the two biomolecules should comply with (`restraints.txt`). They correspond to the minimum number of input you have 
to provide to the web server in order to setup a run.
To run DisVis, go to

<a class="prompt prompt-info" href="http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS">http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS</a>

Then click on the "**Submit**" menu to access the submit form.

<figure align="center">
  <img src="/education/disvis-webserver/disvis_submission.png">
</figure>


* **Step1:** Register for getting access to the web server (or use the credentials provided in case of a workshop).

Click on the "**Register**" menu and fill the required information. Registration is not automatic, so be patient.


* **Step2:** Define the input files and parameters.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Fixed chain -> PRE5.pdb</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Scanning chain -> PUP2.pdb</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Restraints file -> restraints.txt</a>

Once the fields have been filled in you can submit your job to our server 
by clicking on "**Submit**" at the bottom of the page.

If the input fields have been correctly filled you should be redirected to a status page displaying a pop-up message
indicating that your run has been successfully submitted.
While performing the search, the DisVis web server will update you on the progress of the 
job by reloading the status page every 30 seconds.
The example case in this tutorial should run in about 5 minutes on our local servers but due to pre- and post-processing
it might take a bit longer for the result page to appear.

While the calculations are running, open a second tab and go to

<a class="prompt prompt-info" href="http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS">http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS</a>

Then click on the "**Help/Manual**" menu. 

Here, you can have a look at the several features and options of DisVis and read about the meaning of the various input 
parameters (including the ones in "**Advanced options**").

The rotational sampling interval option is given in
degrees and defines how tightly the three rotational degrees of freedom will be
sampled. Voxel spacing is the size of the grid's voxels that will be crossed during the 6D search.
Lower values of both parameters will cause DisVis to perform a finer search, at the
expense of increased computational time. The default value is `15Â°` and `2.0Ã…` for a quick scanning and `9.72Â°` and `1.0Ã…` 
for a complete one. 
For the sake of time in this tutorial, we will keep the sampling interval to the quick scanning value (`15.00Â°`).
The number of processors used for the calculation is fixed on the web server side to 8 processors. 
This number can of course be changed when using the local version of DisVis.


## Analyzing the results

Once your job has completed, and provided you did not close the status page, you will be automatically redirected to the results
page (you will also receive an email notification). The results page presents a summary split into several sections:

* `Status`: In this section you will find a link from which you can download the output data as well as some information
about how to cite the use of the portal.
* `Accessible Interaction Space`: Here, images of the fixed chain together with the accessible interaction space, as 
a density map representation, will be displayed. Several point of views over the molecular scene can be chosen by clicking
 on the right or left part of the image frame. Each set of images matches a specific level of restraints N which corresponds
 to the accessible interaction space by complexes consistent with at least N restraints. A slider vbelow the image container
 gives the possibility to change the level and load the corresponding set of images.
* `Accessible Complexes`: Summary of the statistics for complexes consistent with at least N number of restraints. Statistics
 are displayed for the N levels, N being the total number of restraints provided in the restraints file (here `restraints.txt`)
* `z-Score`: For each restraint provided as input, a z-Score, as a indication of how likely the restraint is a false-positive,
is provided. The higher the score, the most likely a restraint might be a false-positive. Putative false-positive restraints
are highlighted if there was no complexes found to be consistent with a certain number of restraints provided. If DisVis
found complexes consistent with all restraints provided, z-Score will be displayed as an indication but cannot be used to
discriminate true- and false-positive restraints and should be then ignored.
* `Violations`: The table in this sections shows how often a specific restraint is violated for complexes consistent with 
a number of restraints. The higher the violation fraction of a specific restraint, the more likely it is to be a false-positive. 
Column 1 shows the number of consistent restraints N, while each following column indicates the violation fractions of 
a specific restraint for complexes consistent with at least N restraints. Each row thus represents the fraction of all 
complexes consistent with at least N restraints that violated a particular restraint. As for z-Scores, if complexes have
been found to be consistent with all restraints provided, this table should be ignored.

You can have a complete overview of a typical DisVis web server output in the [Example](http://milou.science.uu.nl/cgi/services/DISVIS/disvis/example)
section of the web server. (You will note that this tutorial is an extension of the `26S proteasome` example). 
 
It is already possible to extract significant results from the results page. 

<a class="prompt prompt-question"> Using the different descriptions of the sections we provided above together with the information
on the results page of your run, what are the two restraints DisVis has detected as false-positive?</a>


As mentioned above, the two last sections
feature a table that highlight putative false-positive restraints based o n their z-Score and their violations frequency 
for a specific number of restraints. We will naturally look for the statistics of the highest number of restraints. DisVis
preformat the results in a way that false-positive restraints are highlighted and can be spotted in a glance.
In our case, you should observe that the following two restraints are highlighted as putative false-positives:

`A164(CA)-A49(CA)` and `A49(CA)-A188(CA)`

Tt is difficult to really appreciate the accessible interaction space between the two partners with only images. 
Therefore download to your computer the results archive available at the top of your results page. You will find in it the 
following files:

* `fit_N.pdb`: the best *N* fits, judged by the cross-correlation score.
* `solutions.out`: all the non-redundant solutions found, ordered by their
cross-correlation score. The first column shows the rank, column 2 the correlation
score, column 3 and 4 the Fisher z-score and the number of standard
deviations; column 5 to 7 are the x, y and z coordinate of the center of the
chain; column 8 to 17 are the rotation matrix values.
* `lcc.mrc`: a cross-correlation map showing, at each grid position, the 
highest cross-correlation score found during the search, thus showing the most 
likely location of the center of mass of the structure.
* `powerfit.log`: a log file of the calculation, including the input parameters 
with date and timing information.


Let us inspect now the solutions in Chimera.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Open the density map, the *lcc.mrc* cross-correlation map, and the 10 
best-ranked solutions in Chimera.
</a>

Use for this either the `Menus` or the `command line interface` as explained [before](#inspecting-the-data), e.g.:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/ribosome-KsgA.map
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/lcc.mrc
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/ribosome.pdb
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/fit_*.pdb
</a>


Make the density map transparent again, by adjusting the alpha channel value to
0.6. The values of the `lcc.mrc` slider bar correspond to the cross-correlation
score found. In this way, you can selectively visualize regions of high or low
cross-correlation values: i.e., pushing the slider to the right (higher cutoff)
shows only regions of the grid with high cross-correlation scores. 

As you can see, PowerFit found quite some local optima, one of which stands out
(if the rotational search was tight enough). Further, the 10 best-ranked
solutions are centered on regions corresponding to local cross-correlation maxima.

To view each fitted solution individually, in the main panel, go to `Favorites`
â†’ `Model Panel` to open the `Model Panel` window. The window shows each model
and its associated color that Chimera has processed. To show or hide a specific
model you can click the box in the `S` column.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Go through the 10 solutions one by one to asses their goodness-of-fit
  with the density.
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Do you agree with what PowerFit proposes as the best solution?
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  In a new Chimera session, reopen the density map and the fit that you find 
best.
</a>

Use for this either the `Menus` or the `Command Line`option to load the following files:

* `ribosome-KsgA.map`
* `ribosome.pdb`
* `fit_?.pdb`

Replace *?* by the appropriate solution number.

You now have combined the ribosome structure with the rigid-body fit of KsgA
calculated by PowerFit, yielding an initial model of the complex. Mutagenesis
experiments performed on this complex indicate three charged residues of KsgA -
`R221`, `R222`, and `K223` - that are of special importance for the
interaction. 

In the same session of Chimera where you have your chosen fitted KsgA
structure, go to `Favorites` â†’ `Command Line`. A command line is now present
below the main viewing window.  In the command line of Chimera, type the
following instructions to center your view on these residues and highlight
their interactions:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  show #2:221-223 zr<5 & #1 || #2:221-223  
  center #2:221-223 zr<5 & #1 || #2:221-223
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Take some time to inspect the model, paying particular attention to these three
  residues and their spatial neighbors.
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Are there any clashes between the ribosome and KsgA chains?
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Is the mutagenesis data explained by the model, i.e. are the three charged 
amino acids involved in strong interactions?
</a>

Chimera also includes a tool to locally optimize the fit of a rigid structure 
against a given density map, which can be an additional help on top of the 
PowerFit calculations. Make the main display window active by clicking on it, 

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Go to Tools â†’ Volume data â†’ Fit in Map
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
In the newly opened Fit in Map window, select the best-fitted structure of PowerFit (fit_?.pdb) as 
Fit model and the original density map (ribosome-KsgA.map) as the map.
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Press Fit to start the optimization. 
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Does the Chimera local fit optimization tool improve the results of PowerFit?
</a>

The scoring function used by Chimera to estimate the quality of the fit makes 
our model worse, increasing the number of clashes between the ribosomal RNA and 
KsgA. Click `Undo` in the `Fit in Map` window to undo the optimization.

Next, we will try to optimize the fit using the cross-correlation that Chimera 
provides. 

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Click Options and check the Use map simulated from atoms, resolution box and fill in 13 for resolution. 
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Check the correlation radio button and uncheck the Use only data above contour level from first map. 
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Press Fit. 
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Does this second strategy improve the quality of the fit? If not, undo it 
again.
</a>


## Final remarks

We have demonstrated in this tutorial how to make use of the PowerFit web server to fit
atomic structures in cryo-EM map. 
The obvious limitation of rigid-body fitting is that it cannot account for any
conformational changes that the structures might undergo. Further, the low
resolution of this particular density map does not allow to identify
side-chain atoms. The quality of the fitted models by PowerFit is, therefore,
limited. In particular, such models will typically result in a significant clashes at the interface between molecules.
Such clashes can be removed by making use of the HADDOCK-EM flexible refinement capabilities.
This is demonstrated in the [command line version][link-haddock-tuto] of the PowerFit tutorial and described in:
