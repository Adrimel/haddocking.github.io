## Advanced methods for the integration of diverse structural data with NMR data – 2nd Edition

* Event Date: 11th Apr 2016 to 15th Apr 2016
* Location: SURF Offices Hoog Overborch (Hoog Catharijne), Moreelsepark 48, 3511 EP Utrecht, The NetherlandsPadualaan 8
* [Directions](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/SURF/@52.0891266,5.1113904,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c66f643c8cc5d3:0xb3c244816bf24e33)

The course will start on Monday afternoon April 11th and run until lunch time on Friday April 15th, allowing for arrival and departure in the morning/afternoon of the first and last days.

Utrecht can easily be reached from various airports: Several low-cost companies fly into [Amsterdam Schiphol](http://www.schiphol.nl/), [Rotterdam](http://www.rotterdamthehagueairport.nl/en/) or [Eindhoven](http://www.eindhovenairport.com/en/) airports, which are all connected by direct and fast [trains](http://www.ns.nl/en) to Utrecht (between half an hour to one hour travel time). The [SURF location](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/SURF/@52.0891266,5.1113904,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c66f643c8cc5d3:0xb3c244816bf24e33) is very close to Utrecht central station. 


### Aims of the course

The course aims at training young researchers in the combined use of NMR data with other structural biology techniques, such as SAXS, X-ray diffraction or Cryo-EM in order to understand and rationalize the structural and dynamical properties of macromolecular systems. In addition, this course will introduce and make extensive use of user-friendly e-science portals to facilitate the adoption of the methods and techniques by the students in their everyday work.

The course will provide lectures describing the basics of the methods applied and hands-on training with the intuitive, web-based services of the [WeNMR](http://www.wenmr.eu) infrastructure and the [MoBrain](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI-Engage:WP6#TASK_SA2.5_MoBrain) Competence Center, the [West-Life](http://www.west-life.eu) VRE and the [BioExcel](http://www.bioexcel.eu) center of excellence H2020 EU projects, with the support of [SURFSara](https://www.surf.nl/en/about-surf/subsidiaries/surfsara/), which is part of the MoBrain CC and is supporting us in the organisation of this course. The hands-on sessions will allow the students to try the methods on either pre-packaged or their own research data. The course will address state-of-the-art tools and facilities. Participants will be selected among all applicants taking into account the following criteria: previous experience in the field of biomolecular NMR and structure biology; experience in computational aspects of structural biology; gender balance; relevance of current research to the course contents.


### Application procedure: 

Applicants should send to the lead contact (see below) by email a short CV and letter of motivation explaining how they will benefit from attending this course. The deadline for applying is set to February 15th, 2016. Accepted applicants will be notified by March 1st, 2016.

*Lectures:*

* Characterization of large assemblies by mass spectrometry
* Characterization of macromolecular complexes by X-Ray crystallography and cryo-EM
* Characterization of macromolecular assemblies by solution and solid-state NMR
* Cryo-EM analysis of biomolecular assemblies
* Integration of SAXS and NMR data for the analysis of protein structure/dynamics
* Integrative modelling of biomolecular complexes by docking
* Molecular dynamics for NMR-based protein structure refinement


*Hands-on practical sessions (can be adjusted also depending on the availability of data from the attendees)*

* The AMPS-NMR portal for molecular dynamics and structure refinement
* The HADDOCK portal for data-driven docking
* The MAX-OCC portal for domain dynamics in multidomain proteins
* The Scipion cryo-EM analysis platform

_Note_ that participants are required to bring their ownlaptop, ideally with applications allowing remote ssh access and also VirtualBox installed to allow for running Virtual Machines that will be provided to the participants so that the students can take them back with them for further analysis/use back home. We will also make use of SURFSara cloud resources for the practicals.

Case studies will be provided via the web for re-examination also at the home lab.
