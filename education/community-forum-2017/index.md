In this page you can find links to the tutorials given during the BioExcel Community Forum 2017.
Those tutorials are first attempts to setup a workflow between HADDOCK, CPMD and GROMACS for 
the covalent docking of ligand on an active site of a protein.
It does not aim (yet) at providing a well-established method to do so but rather
open discussions and shows the actual limits of the protocols to solve this
issue.
This suite of tutorials was an initiative of the Integrative Modelling Interest Group
created by BioExcel and any feedback/questions is more than welcome! You can join the
dedicated post on [our forum](http://ask.bioexcel.eu/t/community-forum-2017-modelling-of-a-covalent-inhibitor/629)

In order to have a good idea of the audience and be able to provide you with a tailormade
session, please fill in this short form: <https://goo.gl/forms/OtBHvhnIPGP2drP53>
This should not take you more than a couple of minutes but will be very valuable for these two
days.

## Tutorials

* [**HADDOCK covalent binding**](/education/community-forum-2017/HADDOCK_tutorial):
